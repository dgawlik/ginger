## Features

#### Text Search

Currently strings not regex are searched for performance reasons. This is pretty fast, time
to wait should be 1 second per GB on modern machine.
Once found results can be cycled in buffer.

#### Tabs

Trivial but helpful, everything is handled on
per tab basis.

#### Colorizing

Feature similar as in wireshark. Custom regex
can make lines colored, it can help in navigating.
Coloring is remembered per tab.

#### Go to line

Jumps to line number, if overflown default value is
picked.

#### Bookmarks

Still needs implementing context menu for
right clicking. Currently
line numbers have to entered manually.
