Ginger was created to be a tool to handle large files efficiently. Viewing big
logs is hard and options are limited with regards what editor to choose and frequently
you have to give up features known from editors like Atom.

Top feature of Ginger is that it handles files with unlimited size, and it is really
fast. Initial scan of 1GB file should not take more than 5 seconds on any modern machine.
Only small fragments of files are loaded so memory footprint is very small. Viewing,
scrolling, jumping to certain locations works pretty smooth. There is no risk that
accidentally pressing save will cause editor to freeze.

There is a cool feature in Wireshark - coloring based on pattern.
This program also has it, which is basic (based on regex) but does
its job quite well. While scrolling this really helps to pick up important stuff that
otherwise could be missed.

One of the distinguishing functions are bookmarks. There is no such
option in either Notepad++ or editors in Linux, and it comes in handy when jumping
between different places.
